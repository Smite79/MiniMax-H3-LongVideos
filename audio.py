# NOTHING HERE IS SYNTHESISED ANY MORE. Removed on the report: "Just get rid of

#
# What was here built the soundtrack's non-vocal half out of shaped noise: a room
# tone from the scene's own wording (synth_ambient, over a table of recipes, with
# plain_bed under it as a floor) and 21 foley recipes laid into the shots whose
# audio branch is pinned to silence (foley_for, over _hits/_band/_room and later
# _contact/_flow/_creak, timed off the picture's own movement for footsteps).
#
# It went in because a shot pinned to silence cannot get audio from the model at
# all -- prompt text never opens a branch -- so auto_sound was writing sounds into
# prompts that could not make them. That reasoning was sound and the thing it built
# still did not pass: reported first as footsteps sounding like heartbeats and a
# bathroom that tapped, and then, once both of those measured clean, as horrid
# anyway. Synthesis that measures right and sounds wrong is the end of that road.
#
# So the audio is the model's, whole. H3 is a joint model and the audio branch is
# where its sound comes from; the prompt still describes what a shot sounds like,
# which is the half that was always doing the real work.
#
# The consequence, which is real and is reported in info rather than left to be
# discovered: a shot with no line and no sound you wrote is pinned to silence and
# is now SILENT. The pin is not a bug and is deliberately untouched -- it is what
# stops a free branch filling itself with babble and a face lip-syncing to it.
# Write the sound into the beat to open the branch on purpose, or wire a recording
# to ambient_audio, which is played under the finished track and conditions
# nothing. mix_ambient below is that path, and it is all that is left here.

    """A keyframe audio latent of actual SILENCE, or None if it cannot be made.

    H3 is a JOINT model: the mouth follows the audio branch. On a shot with no
    scripted line the branch is otherwise unconditioned, and an unconditioned audio
    branch invents a voice -- which the picture then lip-syncs to. The lips-closed
    sentence is arguing with a stream that has already decided someone is talking.

    REBUILT 2026-09-05, from measurements against the real VAE rather than from
    reasoning. The previous version encoded one second, kept a SINGLE interior
    frame and repeated it, on the argument that silence is homogeneous. It is not,
    in latent space: encoded silence has genuine frame-to-frame variation (delta
    mean 0.002-0.004, max 0.021), and a repeated frame has a delta of exactly
    0.000000. That is a flat signal no encoder produces, and a model handed
    conditioning outside its own distribution has every reason to disregard it --
    which is an audio branch back to inventing a voice, with the report saying
    silence went on.

    The fix that version was avoiding is real too: tiling the whole encoded second
    end to end leaves a 25x spike at each join (0.554 against 0.022), once per
    second, which is a metronome in the conditioning of a joint model.

    So: encode two seconds, drop the padded ends, and PING-PONG the interior --
    forward, reversed, forward. Every join repeats a frame, so there is no seam,
    and the interior statistics are the encoder's own. Measured over a 9s shot:

        one frame repeated   peak 0.000686   delta mean 0.000000   max 0.000000
        whole 2s tiled       peak 0.000314   delta mean 0.017451   max 0.554715
        interior ping-pong   peak 0.000566   delta mean 0.002039   max 0.021159

    where the encoder's own interior is mean 0.0021, max 0.0212. Decoded peak
    0.000566 on a +/-1.0 scale is about -65 dBFS: silence.

    Everything here stays defensive. Shapes are CHECKED against what the layout
    expects rather than assumed, and any failure returns None so the shot falls
    back to an unconditioned branch instead of breaking the render -- the caller
    reports when that happens, so it is no longer a silent failure.
