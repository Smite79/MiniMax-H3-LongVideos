    THE MEASUREMENT, which is the whole reason this needs no scene list. At every
    boundary the render holds two pictures that are SUPPOSED to be the same frame: K,
    the handoff it gave the shot, and R, frame one of what came back -- the model's own
    reproduction of K, from a keyframe labelled sigma 0.001. Nothing was asked to change
    between them, so everything separating them is the chain's own doing and none of it
    is the author's intent. That is the one difference in the loop that can be corrected
    without guessing at anybody's lighting, and R costs nothing to look at: it is the
    frame trim_seam throws away.

    A beat that walks into a darker room moves K, and R follows it there. So the level is
    never anchored, never compared to shot 1, and never compared to a target -- only K
    against its own reproduction, boundary by boundary.

    WHAT IT WILL NOT FIX. Clipping already baked into earlier shots, because the VAE
    clamps every decode and headroom spent is gone. Softening, which is a different
    measurement and a different cause. Anything spatial -- ghosting, local burn, identity
    drift. A tone curve with a knee in it, since this is affine per channel; the residual
