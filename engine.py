"""The prompt engine: scene state, beat by beat.

WHY THIS REPLACED WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE
--------------------------------------
The old engine was about sixty independent readers, each searching the beat for
its own thing and each appending its own sentence to the shot. `limb_anchor`
found "behind the back", `held_part` found "neck", and neither could see the
other, so the shot went out saying "holding the neck behind the back" -- a neck
behind a back. `hardware_named` returned one item, so a beat that cuffed the
wrists and locked on a collar recorded the collar and the handcuffs were never
mentioned again; hardware nobody mentions is hardware the model stops drawing,
and that read as her breaking out of them. `_PLACE` contained "door", so "Ana
looks at the door" moved the camera into a door.

Every one of those is the same failure: a clause derived on its own, with nothing
holding the facts together and nothing able to notice a contradiction.

So the shape here is different. A beat is parsed ONCE into events. Events update
one explicit state. The state renders ONE paragraph. There is exactly one place
that knows what is on whom, one that knows where anybody is, and one that turns
that into English -- so a contradiction is a bug in a value you can print, not an
emergent property of sixty regexes that never met.

WHAT THE STATE GUARANTEES
    - hardware is remembered per person, with the part it holds, the position it
      holds that part in, and what it is anchored to. All four together or not at
      all, so they cannot disagree.
    - every piece of hardware on a person is named in every shot until something
      takes it off. Not the newest, not the most specific: all of it.
    - a garment is on, off, or displaced, and the shot that changes it says both
      ends of the change.
    - a place is a room somebody can be in. A door is not a room.
