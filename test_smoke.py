"""Smoke test: run the whole render path with fake models.

Nothing here touches a GPU, loads a checkpoint or asks the real model for
anything -- the model, CLIP and both VAEs are stubs that return correctly shaped
tensors. What it exercises is the code the node runs on every render: the shot
loop, conditioning assembly, the keyframe handoff, decode, trim and concat.

This exists because a missing module-level name shipped once and only showed up
as a traceback on the user's first render. Parsing and unit-testing pure
functions did not catch it; running the path does.

Run: python test_smoke.py
