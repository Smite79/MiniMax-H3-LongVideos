    reloaded three lines later to run the decode. An evict-and-reload of the thing

    This is the fix for VRAM ratcheting across a long chain. soft_empty_cache()

    ComfyUI keeps the Qwen3-VL text encoder (~14.6GB) and both VAEs resident in
    current_loaded_models alongside the DiT. Each shot re-encodes the prompt
    (text encoder), encodes the handoff keyframe (video VAE), then samples (DiT),
    so all three compete for the card.

    ComfyUI does free ahead of each load -- load_models_gpu() calls free_memory()
    for what it is about to need (model_management.py:975), so the weight path is
    not purely reactive. What it cannot size for is a long chain's ACTIVATIONS on
    a card where the DiT is most of the VRAM. Freeing explicitly, right after
    conditioning is built and before sampling, keeps only what the sampler needs.

    ~14.6GB text encoder and both VAEs, and the next shot re-encodes the prompt and
    the handoff keyframe, so all three come straight back. On a machine whose RAM is
    already full of finished frames they come back from DISK, once per shot, which is
    the thrashing this was reported as.

    The DiT can size its own activations -- memory_required(shape) is what ComfyUI
    itself calls before a load -- so ask for that. A card with room frees nothing and
    keeps the encoder resident; a card without frees exactly as much as it must.

    rebuilt to stop, at a LARGER size: the list holds the whole upscaled chain and
    the cat allocates a second one, both live at the cat, and `out` is a local that
    is never cleared -- so it survives the cat, survives the trailing resize, and is
    still bound at the return. Meanwhile the CALLER's pre-upscale chain cannot be
    dropped either, because `part = frames[s:s+batch]` is a view into it.

    IN CHUNKS, BECAUSE LANCZOS IS FOUR FULL-LENGTH COPIES. The whole chain went
    into one common_upscale call, and comfy.utils.lanczos is three successive list
    comprehensions over every frame at once:

    A comprehension builds the new list completely before rebinding the name, so at

    still exists, and .to() allocates the result while the stack still exists. Note
    the astype(np.float32): the input is fp16 but the two largest transients are at
    DOUBLE its width. At 2580 frames to a 1080 short edge that peaked around 147GB
    to produce a 29GB result, and it fires on a DOWNSCALE too.

    Chunked, the peak is the result plus one chunk's worth of that machinery. It is
    bit-identical: PIL resizes each frame independently, so per-chunk and per-chain
    give the same pixels. The early return for an already-correct size is kept, so

# Every shot boundary decodes a shot, hands its LAST frame over, and re-encodes that as
# the next shot's keyframe. The distill reproduces the keyframe faithfully enough to
# inherit whatever is already in it and SYNTHESISES frame 0 rather than copying it, so
# its own bias lands on top: S_next = a*S + b, a near 1, b above 0. Linear at best,
# geometric at worst, invisible shot to shot. And the VAE hard-clips every decode to
# 0..1, which makes the expansion a RATCHET -- headroom spent is not recoverable, so it
# shows as crushed blacks and blown highlights rather than merely as more contrast.
#
# These two are the measurement and the correction. Both work per colour channel,
# because the clip is per channel: the VAE un-whitens with ImageNet stds before it
# clamps, so the 0..1 rails sit at different distances in each channel and the blue
# floor and red ceiling bite first. A single luma number would miss the colour half.
